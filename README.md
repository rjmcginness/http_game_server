utilizes game_engine from version 1
complete redesign


5/13/2022  Getting there.  Able to request and render files all the way to start page.
            Currently, debugging quiz.py and quiz_view.py.
            Still need to fix the issue with having to stop loading page and re-requesting
            page to load.  This may have something to do with favicon.ico.  Might need to
            send a fake (or real) icon.  May want to make it non-cacheable, so that it is
            predictable, when the browser will request it.
